      <h2>Legacy Systems & Integration</h2>
      <p>Evo Engineering stands on the shoulders of Southwest Systems Integrators. Our roots run deep in systems automation,
      fabrication, and integration, carried forward through decades of trust and results.</p>
      <p>Founded by <strong>Michael Weedman</strong>, our family name became synonymous with precision and reliability. From ducting systems for Amazon facilities
      to material handling and automation projects for major clients, our work has always delivered.</p>
      <h2>Clients We’ve Served</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>PepsiCo</li>
        <li>Coca-Cola</li>
        <li>Amazon</li>
        <li>CenterPoint Energy (Houston)</li>
        <li>Schlumberger</li>
        <li>Tito’s Vodka (we installed their first automated bottling line)</li>
        <li>Artco-Bell Corporation (Temple, Texas)</li>
        <li>Textiles, food & beverage, and material handling plants across Texas and beyond</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What We Learned</h2>
      <p>From textiles to food and beverage to energy, SSI was always about integration — making equipment, automation, and people work as one.
      Evo carries that DNA forward: bridging legacy systems into modern architectures without losing the reliability that built our name.</p>
      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>Legacy matters because it proves we’ve been trusted where it counts. Evo Engineering doesn’t just promise renewal — we’ve lived it,
      from shop floors to Fortune 1000 facilities. The same integrity that Michael Weedman built SSI with is the backbone of Evo today.</p>
